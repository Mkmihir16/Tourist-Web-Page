        It is an exciting world on the bank of Gandhi Sagar. Here Science is no more a subject but an experience. Here science is a thing to play with & learn. Here one is free to spend a whole day in play with hands-on exhibits-press lever, turn wheels, roll balls, pull strings, press the buttons, look through the peepholes to make science work & enjoy. One can discover that, here concept of science is different: It is sheer fun.
