    <p class="paragraph">The Swaminarayan temple is an extremely beautiful and very well-maintained temple which has been built on a huge plot of land and has been landscaped in a very pleasing and aesthetic manner. The serenity experienced there, and the lighting effects were outstanding.Standing majestically Golden in the night - this temple is a treat to the eyes and mind even before entering. Everything is so well maintained and managed. Reached at the time of aarti and it was a beautiful experience. Bit of a climbing but there are lifts available for those who couldn't. Very helpful staff. Parking is available. No entry fee. One can perform Abhishek pooja and be blessed. Also there are counters where you could purchase souvenir, clothing, pooja items etc.</p>
